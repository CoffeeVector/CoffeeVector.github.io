            <p>
            My feeble attempt at an AI that can solve a Rubiks Cube.
            The Rubiks Cube was represented as a 54 long vector, and all moves were represented as matrix operations.
            The reasoning for this as opposed to a 3x3x6 array is written in more detail in the documentation.

            <p>
            I was responsible for making data analysis code that finds the speed of light by interpreting data from an oscilloscope, function generator, laser, and photosensor.

            <p>
            In short, the code curve fitted and compared two 25MHz signals, one being delayed by a laser and photosensor.
            We obtained \\(2.9 \\times 10^8 \\pm 6 \\times 10^6 \\text{m}/\\text{s}\\) and an \\(r^2\\) of \\(0.998\\).
