# Install instructions

If you want nothing but defaults:
`make`

If you want a specific theme:
`make theme={theme}`

`{theme}` can be anything from the following:
 - `allure`
 - `golden-air`
 - `infinities`
 - `the-minimalist`
 - `unwavering`

After the command is run, the static files will be found in the `build` directory.
